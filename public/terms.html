  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: June 12, 2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to Getani. By using our website and services, you agree to these Terms of Service.</p>

  <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
  <p>Getani allows users to generate AI-generated images using natural language prompts. A credit system is used to manage generation limits per user plan (Free, Basic, Pro, Premium).</p>

  <h2>2. User Accounts</h2>
  <p>You must create an account using a valid email address. Users are responsible for keeping their credentials secure. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms.</p>

  <h2>3. Credits and Plans</h2>
  <p>Credits are required to generate images. Free users are allocated a limited number of credits. Paid subscriptions provide more credits and may renew monthly. Refunds are not guaranteed.</p>

  <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You agree not to use the service for unlawful, harmful, or abusive purposes. This includes but is not limited to generating images that are offensive, violent, explicit, or infringe on intellectual property rights.</p>

  <h2>5. Ownership and Licensing</h2>
  <p>You retain rights to images you generate, subject to the terms of any applicable AI model licenses. We do not claim ownership but may store generated content temporarily for user access.</p>

  <h2>6. Service Availability</h2>
  <p>Getani is provided “as-is.” We may modify or discontinue the service at any time. We do not guarantee uninterrupted access or image quality.</p>

  <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>We are not liable for damages or losses resulting from use or inability to use the service. Use at your own risk.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these terms periodically. Continued use after changes implies agreement to the new terms.</p>
